#  DECNET MAC Address calculator

This project builds a very basic DECNET Mac Address calculator. Its usage is really simple and should
be just obvious.

It has been built using XCode 10.1 running under Mojave, but it does not use any feature not
available in any reasonabily up to date MacOS Version.
